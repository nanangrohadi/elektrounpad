										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>EVENT DESCRIPTION</h4>
<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry&#8217;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic<br />
typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>EVENT CONTENT</h4>
<ul class="thim-list-content">
<li>Over 37 lectures and 55.5 hours of content!</li>
<li>LIVE PROJECT End to End Software Testing Training Included.</li>
<li>Learn Software Testing and Automation basics from a professional trainer from your own desk.</li>
<li>Information packed practical training starting from basics to advanced testing techniques.</li>
